The introduction chapter presents the purpose and the goals of the thesis, what questions the thesis aims to answer and the limitations of the thesis.

This thesis examines the construction of a recommender system and the evaluation of two different recommender algorithms, \textit{link-analysis} and \textit{katz-eig}. Both of the algorithms had their parameter space analysed and different optimization strategies were evaluated using several different datasets. The recommender system was built for Comordo Technologies as their recommender system to later be built upon and extended.
