\textit{2-4 related questions. The more specific the better!}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How can learning and recommendation be performed in practice, with regards to speed and recommendation quality?

    \item How shall learning and optimization of the algorithms' parameters be done?

          How does the parameter space vary with different datasets? What will the stopping criteria be during the learning phase?

    \item Is clustering beneficial for speed or recommendation quality?

          The hypothesis is improvement in both aspects and it may allow handling of larger datasets.
          Is it possible to utilize parallelization in conjunction with clustering?
\end{itemize}
