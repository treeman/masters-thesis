2-4 related questions. The more specific the better!

\subsection*{How will we perform learning and recommendation in practice?}

Balance execution speed and the quality of the recommendations. How will we split up the data during training?

\subsection*{How shall learning and optimization of the algorithm's parameters be done?}

How does the parameter space vary?

\subsection*{How will the stopping criteria be handled?}

This possibly isn't specific enough?

\subsection*{Is clustering beneficial for speed or quality reasons?}

The hypothesis is improvement in both aspects. It may allow us to handle larger datasets.

Is it possible to utilize parallelization in conjunction with clustering for speed?
