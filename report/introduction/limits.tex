\textit{Avgr√§nsningar?}

Although the goal is to handle real time data, the data handled will still be of a smaller size, as some of the algorithms are not very fast. The algorithms are not optimized enough to handle the larger data sets which limits the abilities to make optimizations for them.

The algorithm's perhaps slow runtime will be a consideration during the selection and evaluation of optimization techniques.

There are different kinds of interaction history such as ratings, interaction count and like or dislike. We will only consider a simple kind of interaction history where each user-product pair will be a binary value, no matter how many times the user has interacted with the product. This is to simplify the analysis, different types of interaction history benefits from different types of algorithms and evaluations.

The existing algorithms are currently written in Matlab which might negatively impact the runtime and handling of larger datasets. Focus will not be on porting them to a different language, which could improve them speed wise, but focus will be on optimization the Matlab code.
