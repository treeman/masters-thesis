\section{Limitations}\label{sec:intro:limitations}

Although the goal is to handle real world data, the data considered in the thesis is of a limited size compared to the larger real world data. The algorithms are not optimized enough to handle the larger data and they are not very fast even with fixed parameters, which makes the parameter tuning algorithms time consuming by default. But the runtime of the algorithms is considered during the selection and evaluation of optimization techniques.

This thesis focuses on \textit{implicit feedback} systems with interaction history in \textit{unweighted binary form} \eqref{eq:hist} which is also the focus for Comordo. \textit{Explicit feedback} like ratings was not prioritized. Interactions in \textit{weighted form} \eqref{eq:whist} might be interesting for Comordo, but it is not considered in this thesis. The \textit{cold start problem} \citep{cacheda2011comparison} is not considered in this thesis and no attempts are made to explain the recommendations.

Proprietary datasets used and code produced during the thesis will not be publicly released. See \sectionref{sec:datasets} for a description of used datasets.

The purpose is to lay a foundation for Comordo's recommender system, but it does not include the remote API or the admin web interface (see \sectionref{sec:task}).
