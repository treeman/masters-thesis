\textit{Avgr√§nsningar? Delimitations?}

Although the goal is to handle real time data, the data handled will still be of a smaller size, as some of the algorithms are not very fast. The algorithms are not optimized enough to handle the larger data sets which limits the abilities to make optimizations for them.

The algorithm's perhaps slow runtime will be a consideration during the selection and evaluation of optimization techniques.
