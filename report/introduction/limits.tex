\section{Limitations}\label{sec:intro:limitations}

Although the goal is to handle real world data, the data considered in the thesis is of a limited size compared to the larger real world data. The implementations of the algorithms are not optimized enough to handle the larger data in a reasonable amount of time and under the memory limit of my machine\footnote{The test setup is described in \sectionref{cha:param}.}.  It is possible to optimize the implementations by rewriting them or porting them to another language but it is outside the scope of this thesis.

This thesis focuses on \textit{implicit feedback} systems with interaction history in \textit{unweighted binary form} \eqref{eq:hist} which is also the focus for Comordo. \textit{Explicit feedback} like ratings was not prioritized. Interactions in \textit{weighted form} \eqref{eq:whist} might be interesting for Comordo, but it is not considered in this thesis. The \textit{cold start problem} \citep{cacheda2011comparison} is not considered in this thesis and no attempts are made to explain the recommendations.

Proprietary datasets used and code produced during the thesis will not be publicly released. See \sectionref{sec:datasets} for a description of used datasets.

The purpose is to lay a foundation for Comordo's recommender system, but it does not include the remote API or the admin web interface (see \sectionref{sec:task}).
