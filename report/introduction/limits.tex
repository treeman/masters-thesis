Although the goal is to handle real time data, the data handled will still be of a smaller size, as some of the algorithms are not very fast. The algorithms are not optimized enough to handle the larger data sets which limits the abilities to make optimizations for them. Therefore data of smaller size will be the focus.

The algorithm's runtime will be a consideration during the selection and evaluation of optimization techniques.

This thesis will handle implicit feedback systems with a binary classification recommender system as this is the focus for Comordo and ratings are not as prioritized for them.

The existing algorithms are currently written in Matlab which might negatively impact the runtime and handling of larger datasets. Focus will not be on porting them to a different language, which could improve them speed wise, but focus will be on optimizing the existing algorithms in Matlab.

Proprietary datasets used and code produced during the thesis will not be publicly released.
