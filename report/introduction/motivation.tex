Describe the problem and make it clear that it's interesting and important to study closer. Make the reader interested.

Information is king.

Being able to choose has always been an important skill and perhaps it's more important now than ever before. Every minute over 300 hours of video is uploaded to Youtube alone. It's hard to choose what videos to watch and especially hard to find something enjoyable. This is why...

In today's society, data is everywhere. The amount of data available on the internet only a few clicks away is staggering. 

In the modern day, data collection is growing more and more prevalent. Search providers or social media like Google and Facebook are obvious examples, their whole existence is built on data collection and aggregation, but it's prevalent in other services as well. Your local store or cinema will often have a record of your purchase history, not because it's their purpose to track you, but it's a byproduct of you purchasing things from them. Websites may check what links you click and what sites you came from, and especially what ads you're clicking on.

This information, your purchase or interaction history, can be used to guess what you're interested in and can produce recommendations for you.
