\section{Purpose}\label{sec:intro:purpose}

The purpose of the thesis is to lay the foundation of Comordo Technologies' recommender system which can later be built upon and extended.

Core parts of the recommendation algorithms exists before the thesis, but they are only runnable as Matlab scripts without any data handling and they lack parameter tuning.

When this thesis is done the goal is to have a recommendation system which can load data supplied by Comordo's clients, produce recommendations and store them together with their recommendations in a database.

The parameters for the recommendation algorithms shall be tuned and optimized for different data sets. This should be done automatically for new datasets and in a reasonable amount of time so the system can be commercially useful.
