\section{Purpose}\label{sec:intro:purpose}

The purpose of this thesis can be split in two larger parts. The first was to lay the foundation of Comordo Technologies' recommender system which could be built upon and extended. At the end of this thesis the goal was to have a recommendation system which could load data supplied by Comordo's clients, produce recommendations and store them together with their recommendations in a database.

The second part was to analyze and create optimization strategies for \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis} which optimize the algorithm's parameters for different datasets automatically. This part should be done in a reasonable amount of time so the system can be commercially useful for Comordo.
