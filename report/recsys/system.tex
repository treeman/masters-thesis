\section{System overview}\label{sec:res:sys}

Some changes were made to Commordo's original system sketch, as described in \sectionref{sec:sysoverview}. The system as a whole is described by \figureref{fig:sysfinal}.

The logic of the recommender system is built of two major parts: the \textit{reader module} and the \textit{recommender module}. Several modules from the original sketch has become submodules inside the recommender module. This is a logical grouping as the reader module and the recommender module are both implemented as separate scripts and the submodules represents a higher level description of the implemented functionality. 

The \textit{exporter module} is an utility module which generates recommendations from the database into another output format and serves statistics and as a developer debugging tool.  The remote API and the admin web interface are included in the system sketch, but they are not implemented by this thesis.
