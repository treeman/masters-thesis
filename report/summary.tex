A recommender system based on \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis} with analysis and tuning of the learning parameters was designed. The parameter $\beta$ was fixed for \textit{katz-eig} and the parameter $K$ was found using hill climbing. $\eta$ was locked to $\eta = 1 \text{ or } -1$ for \textit{link-analysis} and $\gamma$ was found using adaptive hill climbing.
