%A recommender system based on \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis} with analysis and tuning of the learning parameters is designed. The parameter $\beta$ is fixed for \textit{katz-eig} and the parameter $K$ is found using hill climbing. $\eta$ is locked to $\eta = 1 \text{ or } -1$ for \textit{link-analysis} and $\gamma$ is found using adaptive hill climbing.

1. Why

2. How

3. (Some results...)

4 Conclusions

SELL the thesis!!!

Implicit feedback recommender systems are important for Comordo Technologies.... Make recommendations for users without them having to do anything.
