Recommendations are becoming more and more important in a world where there is an abundance of possible choices and e-commerce and content providers are featuring recommendations prominently. Recommendations based on \textit{explicit feedback}, where user is giving feedback for example with ratings, has been a popular research subject. \textit{Implicit feedback} recommender systems which passively collects information about the users is an area growing in interest. It makes it possible to generate recommendations based purely from a users interactions history without requiring any explicit input from the users, which is commercially useful for a wide area of businesses. This thesis builds a recommender system based on implicit feedback using the recommendation algorithms \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis} and analyzes and implements strategies for learning optimized parameters for different datasets. The resulting system forms the foundation for Comordo Technologies commercial recommender system.
