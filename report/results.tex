\chapter{Results}\label{cha:Results}

%\textit{Pure facts and as objectively as possible. Don't analyze, comment or evaluate.  If describe implementation process, only describe largest decisions.}

This chapter presents the results of this thesis. First the created recommender system is described with a new system sketch and the modules and their roles. Then an analysis of the dataset is made with interactions and clusters being examined. Examination of the convergence criteria of the algorithms follow.  The chapter is concluded with performance measures of different optimization strategies and a comparison of the different algorithms.
