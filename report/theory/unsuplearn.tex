In contrast with supervised learning, \textit{unsupervised learning} doesn't have an expected output to learn from. Instead the task is to learn patterns in the input without any feedback.

The most common unsupervised learning task is \textit{clustering}: detecting potentially useful clusters, or groups, of input examples. \citep{norvigAI}
\Warning[TODO]{ Need an explanation of clustering! Algorithm may not be necessary, but at least some references? }
