To produce top-N recommendations given predictions $p_{u, i}$ for each user $u$ and each item $i$, take the $N$ largest $p_{u_k, i} \, \forall i$ for each user $u_k$ and set $r_{u, i} = 1$ for these $N$ values. Set $r_{u, i} = 0$ for the rest. It is possible to set $r_{u, i} = 0$ if $p_{u, i} \leq \epsilon$, for some $\epsilon$, to accommodate for fewer than $N$ recommendations.

To transform datasets with the more common explicit feedback style of ratings to an unweighted binary form a crude model \eqref{eq:rating2binary} was used.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:rating2binary}
    h_{u, i} = \begin{cases}
        1 \quad \text{user $u$ has rated item $i$} \\
        0 \quad \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
