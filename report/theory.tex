Name should either be theory, related work or theoretical reference. Ask adviser.

Did I do the research?? Can I as a reader trust what the author is writing? After reading this part it should be clear to the reader that the question are good and well defined.

Things I need to research more:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cost functions with respect to recommendations, is precision/recall/F-measure the best?
    \item Validation sets. When to use, when it doesn't matter?
    \item Various optimization techniques?
    \item Collaborative filtering, neighbours? \cite{Yifan:2008}
    \item Matrix factorization.
\end{enumerate}

Things to write about:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item LinkAnalysis. Written about in \cite{Zan:2007}.
    \item Evaluation. Precision/Recall/F-measure?
    \item Data splitting for training/evaluation
\end{enumerate}
