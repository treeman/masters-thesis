\chapter{Methodology}\label{cha:method}

This chapter presents the development methodology used, then the datasets used and finally the evaluation method for evaluating recommendation quality are presented.

The thesis can be split in two major parts. A system development part where a first version of Commordo's recommender system is built, the ``glue'' around the recommender algorithms. The second part with development of a learning framework for the algorithms and an analysis of the algorithms' parameters.

The focus on the beginning is on the system development part and with that in place the focus shiftes to the learning framework and parameter tuning.
