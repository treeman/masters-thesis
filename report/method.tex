\chapter{Methodology}\label{cha:method}

\textit{Describe how the work is supposed to be done. Should be able to replicate the work.}

\textit{Discuss implementation choices and alternatives here?}

\Warning[TODO]{ section: Model? }
\Warning[TODO]{ Do NOT discuss alternatives here? Move on to discussion??? }

The thesis can be split in two major parts. A system development part where a first version of Commordo's recommender system shall be built, the "glue" around the recommender algorithms. The second part is developing a learning framework for the algorithms and analyzing the optimization of the algorithms' learning parameters.

General focus will at the beginning be on the system development part and with that in place shift focus to the algorithms.
