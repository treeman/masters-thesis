\chapter{Methodology}\label{cha:method}

\textit{Describe how the work is supposed to be done. Should be able to replicate the work.}

The thesis can be split in two major parts. A system development part where a first version of Commordo's recommender system was built, the ``glue'' around the recommender algorithms. The second part with development of a learning framework for the algorithms and an analysis of the algorithms' parameters.

The focus on the beginning was on the system development part and with that in place the focus shifted to the learning framework and parameter optimization.
