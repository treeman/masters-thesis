This chapter introduces the mathematical theory behind recommendations and the recommendation model used by this thesis. The recommendation algorithms \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis} are presented and a summary of machine learning follow which explains supervised learning and the evaluation metrics used. A section about optimization techniques finishes the chapter.


\section{Recommendation theory}

This section introduces the mathematical theory behind recommendations and it presents the two recommendation algorithms \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis}.

This is the basic process of producing recommendations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given an interaction history $h_{u, i}$, $u \in Users$, $i \in Items$ and algorithm specific parameters the recommendation algorithm produce recommendations $p_{u, i}$.
    \item The recommendations $p_{u, i}$, which are real values, are converted to binary recommendations $r_{u, i}$ by selecting the $N$ largest $p_{u, i}$ as $r_{u, i} = 1$.
\end{enumerate}

The process of parameter tuning used is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Split the interaction matrix $A$ into a training set $A_{train}$, a validation set $A_{val}$ and a test set $A_{test}$.
    \item Evaluate different parameters by producing recommendations with $A_{train}$ and evaluating them against $A_{val}$ or $A_{test}$ with respect to \textit{F-measure}.
    \item Select the best performing parameters with respect to \textit{F-measure}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Machine learning}

In this section a summary of supervised learning explaining how learning from the datasets is accomplished. A short summary of unsupervised learning, mainly focused on clustering, follows and metrics for evaluating recommendation quality is presented at the end of the section.
