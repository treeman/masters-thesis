Comordo Technologies is a startup in recommendation systems driven inside the bounds of LiU's incubator LEAD in Link√∂ping and will in the future offer a cloud service for e-commerce. The base for the recommendation system is algorithms based on predication and machine learning. The company now stands to build a first version of it's recommendation system.

Comordo focuses on binary classification with implicit feedback such as generating recommendations for e-commerce using purchase history for users.

Needs to be able to actually run the algorithms, handle data and to automatically learn and optimize the algorithms and fit them to different types of data.

\Warning[TODO]{Rework paragraph}
