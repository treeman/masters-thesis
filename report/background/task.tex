The system development task for this thesis was to complete the backend of Comordo's system. This included the reader, input, output and parameter modules, the storage of purchase history and parameters and modules for parameter tuning. The other databases were provided, but with some level of adaptation needed. The recommender algorithms \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis} were given and again some adaptation need. The admin interface and the remote API were not included in this thesis.
