The system development task for this thesis is to complete the backend of Comordo's system. This includes the reader, input, output and parameter modules, the storage of purchase history and parameters and modules for parameter tuning. The other databases were provided, but some level of adaptation was needed. The recommender algorithms \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis} were given and again some adaptation was needed. The admin interface and the remote API are outside the scope of this thesis.
