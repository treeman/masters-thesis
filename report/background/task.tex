The task for this thesis is to complete the backend of Commordo's system. This includes the reader, input, output and parameter modules, the storage of purchase history and parameters and algorithms for parameter tuning. The other databases will be provided, but some level of adaptation might be needed. The admin interface and the remote API are not included in this thesis.
