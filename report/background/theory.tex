This section introduces the mathematical theory behind the recommendation model, a summary of the supervised learning process and some theory about the evaluation metrics \textit{Precision}, \textit{Recall} and \textit{F-measure}. Then a brief overview of optimization techniques is given and then explanation of the recommendation algorithms \textit{link-analysis} and \textit{katz-eig}. The section is finished by a brief mention of unsupervised learning techniques, mainly about clustering.

%This section introduces the mathematical theory behind the recommendation model, the evaluation of recommendations and a summary of the supervised learning process.
%\Warning[TODO]{ Make sure these are up to date }

This is the basic process of producing recommendations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given an interaction history $h_{u, i}$ and algorithm specific parameters the recommendation algorithm produce recommendations $p_{u, i}$.
    \item The recommendations $p_{u, i}$, which are real values, are converted to binary recommendations $r_{u, i}$.
\end{enumerate}

The process of parameter tuning used is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Split the interaction matrix $A$ into a training set $A_{train}$, a validation set $A_{val}$ and a test set $A_{test}$.
    \item Evaluate different parameters by producing recommendations with $A_{train}$ and evaluating them against $A_{val}$ or $A_{test}$ with respect to \textit{F-measure}.
    \item Select the best performing parameters with respect to \textit{F-measure}.
\end{enumerate}
