\subsection{Unsupervised learning}

\Warning[TODO]{ Decide if this section is even needed! }

In contrast with supervised learning, \textit{unsupervised learning} doesn't have an expected output to learn from. Instead the task is to learn patterns in the input without any feedback.

The most common unsupervised learning task is \textit{clustering}: detecting potentially useful clusters, or groups, of input examples. \citep{norvigAI}

\Warning[TODO]{ Need explanation of K-means clustering. Algorithmic details may not be necessary but at least some explanation.}
