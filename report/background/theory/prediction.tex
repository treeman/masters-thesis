\subsection{Recommendation prediction}\label{sec:background:theory:pred}

The algorithms which produce binary classification recommendations produce predictions for each user-item pair, denoted $p_{u, i}$. Generally the higher the value of $p_{u, i}$ the more likely is it that user $u$ will interact with item $i$. In a classification context when the interaction history describes ratings the value corresponds to the predicted ratings user $u$ would give $i$. For example if $p_{u, i} = 3.8$ means a user $u$ is predicted to rate item $i$ a 4, given discrete ratings between 1 and 5.

Some algorithms also output a confidence value $c_{u, i}$ which denotes how certain the predicted values are. This is relevant when predicting ratings, for example $p_{u, i} = 4.0$ may seem like a surely predicted 4 rating but a low value of $c_{u, i}$ means we might not want to recommend that item anyway.
