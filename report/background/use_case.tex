This is a high level use case for how Comordo's recommender system will be used via the remote API and how recommendations will be produced for Comordo's clients.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Purchase history and product data is provided by e-commerce clients and consumed by the recommender system.
    \item Load algorithms with purchase history and 
    \item Repopulate recommendation database with new recommendations.
    \item Final customers visit the e-commerce website and are given recommendations delivered to the website via Comordo's remote API.
\end{enumerate}
