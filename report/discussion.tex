Future direction/thoughts about recommender systems.

Combinations of different algorithms instead of one super algorithm to rule them all.

Diversity is important! Netflix has identified that one account is used by the whole family, so diverse recommendations to fulfill the need of the different family members are needed. Diversity is a measure for that, also used by the eswc competition.

Explaining recommendations increases the trust for the recommendations and make them more effective.

Offline/online and generating recommendations in real time.

Changes of $\eta$ as long as $\eta > 0$ appears to not have a very big impact. This can be explained as the role of $\eta$ is to keep the user representativeness score high for each user to itself. The normalization step in the nextcoming iteration removes the impact of larger value of $\eta$.

$\eta < 0 $ is harder to explain...
