\textit{How does the results hold up? Compare to theory breakthrough. Anything unusual or surprising?}

\subsection{link-analysis}

Referenced article introduces $\eta$, but treats it as a constant. My findings are different and shows better results for other values, possibly even for negative values.

Similarly $\gamma$ is said to be in the range 0 to 1, but I found that larger ones are good and often even better.
