\textit{Discuss and critique for the methods chosen.}

\textit{Also discuss sources.}

The usage of the \textit{movielens1m} dataset can be questioned as the dataset is made up by ratings and then converted to unweighted binary form. This introduces a lot of noise and the question is what conclusions can be drawn from such a dataset.

The evaluation metric of \textit{F-measure} can be questioned/discussed...? Why no cost function? Probably would be better (if could be found, but can it?) ?

Optimization technique interesting to try is bayesian optimization! (can we try it?)

Clustering would be nice to explore (if we don't do it in the thesis).
