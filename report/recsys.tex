\chapter{The Comordo recommender system}\label{cha:recsys}

The thesis can be split in two major parts. The first part is a system development part where a first version of Comordo's recommender system is built, the ``glue'' around the recommender algorithms. The second part with development of a learning framework for the algorithms and an analysis of the algorithms' parameters. This chapter describes the system development part.

First is some background information about Comordo Technologies and the task given by Comordo for the construction of the recommender system which is the main purpose of the thesis from Comordo's point of view. A system sketch provided by Comordo and a use case of their product is included. Then follows the development methodology used during this thesis and how evaluation of the recommendations is done. The final section presents the developed recommender system and its modules.
