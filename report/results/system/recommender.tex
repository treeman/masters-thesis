\subsection{Recommender module}

The recommender module is the core of the recommender system. It is responsible for populating the databases with new recommendations and for optimizing the algorithms' parameters to new datasets.

\Warning[TODO]{ More descriptions of the capabilities }

Below follows a short description of the different submodules and their function.

\begin{description}
    \item[Input module] reads the interaction history from the database.
    \item[Controller] selects which algorithm to use and if the purpose is to optimize the parameters or to generate recommendations.
    \item[Parameter tuner] is responsible to optimize and fit the algorithms' to a new dataset.
    \item[link-analysis, katz-eig] are the available recommender algorithms.
    \item[Output module] populates the database with new recommendations.
\end{description}
