\subsection{Exporter module}

The exporter module's main function is to generate recommendation output in a file format. This serves as both a workaround for the lack of a working remote API and as an extra feature as Comordo's e-commerce clients might request the recommendations in a file format. It acts as an easy way of creating a formatted database dump.

The secondary function is to serve statistics and act as a developer debugging tool. Examination of the dataset and the generated recommendations can be made. It can be used to examine a user, the history and the recommendations generated.
