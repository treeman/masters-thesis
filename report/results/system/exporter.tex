\subsection{Exporter module}

The exporter module's main function is to generate recommendation output in a file format. This serves as both a workaround for the lack of a working remote API and as an extra feature as Commordo's e-commerce clients might request the recommendations in a file format.  The secondary function is to serve statistics and act as a developer debugging tool.

In the future this module could be replaced by either the remote API or the admin web interface.
