Learning curves plots the evaluation metric with respect to a varying training set size. The expectation here is that the algorithms should fit better the bigger the training set size becomes, given the same test set. The algorithms should produce better recommendations the more data they have to learn from. Learning curves is a good way to see if the algorithms work like they're supposed to.

%Learning curves plots the evaluation metric with respect to a varying training set size. Evaluated with a top-10 recommender list, using F-measure.

%\textit{x-axis should it be training size or percent?}

%XXX link-analysis is slower the more training data we have.
%katz-eig is practically indifferent.
%plot time!

\Warning[TODO]{ link is slower the more data we have, katz-eig is basically indifferent }
