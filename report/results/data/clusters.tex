\subsection{Clusters}\label{sec:result:clusters}

Clustering with regards to compactness was examined using \textit{k-means} and with regards to connectivity using \textit{spectral clustering}. Compactness refer the closeness in space of the nodes in each cluster and connectivity refer to how connected the nodes in each cluster are with each other. In the recommendation domain compactness refers to how similar the users' full interaction history is to each other and connectivity instead examines similarity over user-item links.

As an example for two users who are close with respect to connectivity but not to compactness is when one user has a small subset of the other user's interactions.
