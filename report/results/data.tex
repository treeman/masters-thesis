\section{Dataset analysis}\label{sec:results:data}

This section contains an analysis of the available datasets. Some of the datasets were very large and later in the thesis all datasets were not used as the runtime was so long. For example not all datasets were handled in the parameter analysis in \sectionref{sec:parameters}. Specifically the datasets \textit{alpha}, \textit{alpha2} and \textit{eswc2015music} are often excluded and \textit{eswc2015movies} is also excluded sometimes.
