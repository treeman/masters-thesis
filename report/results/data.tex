This section contains an analysis of the available datasets. Some of the datasets were very large and later in the thesis all datasets were not used as the runtime was so long. For example not all datasets were handled in the parameter analysis in \sectionref{sec:parameters}. Specifically the datasets \textit{alpha}, \textit{alpha2} and \textit{eswc2015music} are often excluded and \textit{eswc2015movies} is also excluded sometimes.

The data were analyzed in two ways. Firstly the number of interactions were examined, both with respect to users and to items. All datasets were found to be top heavy, with \textit{alphaS} less so, with few very popular items encompassing most of the user base. Secondly clusters in the datasets were searched for with respect to compactness, or user similarities, using \textit{k-means} and on connectivity using \textit{spectral clustering}. Connected clusters were identified in all datasets.
