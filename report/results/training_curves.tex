\section{Training curves}\label{sec:graphs:training_curves}

Both \textit{katz-eig} and \textit{link-analysis} are iterative algorithms. Their descriptions use the phrase ``repeat until convergence''.  With training curves, which plots the evaluation metric with the respect to epochs, the number of iterations, the effect of running more iterations can be seen.

Each $K$ are different for each dataset, see \appendixref{app:opt_params}, and $beta = \frac{1}{\|A_{train}\|_2}$.

The jagged line represents $\|S_t - S_{t - 1}\|_2$, which is a measure of the difference between the current iteration $t$ and the previous iteration. This was made as a measure of the convergence criteria. Convergence was reached with relatively few iterations, but the matrix $S$ is small and the calculation has low complexity.

In all following usages of \textit{katz-eig}, a value of $\epsilon = 0.01$ was used to break iterations if $\|S_t - S_{t - 1}\|_2 < \epsilon$.

\subsection{link-analysis}

Each $\gamma$ and $\eta$ are different for each dataset, see \appendixref{app:opt_params}.

\Warning[TODO]{ More plots }

For \textit{link-analysis} convergence is also fast. The choice here was to fix $t_{max}$ to a fixed value instead of measuring convergence either by calculating $\| \IR_t - \IR_{t - 1} \|_2$
or by explicitly calculating \textit{F-measure} and measuring the change. This was done because the iteration step in \textit{link-analysis}, in contrast to \textit{katz-eig}, handles large matrices and calculations such as these would be time consuming.

In all following usages of \textit{link-analysis}, the iteration count was fixed to $t_{max} = 3$.
