\section{Development methodology}

The software was developed using agile inspired methods. Iterative development was used to produce a simple prototype and then iteratively improved upon with more features.  The priority early on was to produce a working chain from reading data to storing recommendations in the database.

Small incremental goals was used, for example to complete a reader plugin for a specific dataset.  Automatic tests and unit tests was used but not in the test driven development way, the requirement for the tests being made before the functionality was relaxed and not required.


\subsection{Programming languages}

The existing algorithms exists in a prototype form in Matlab. The thesis continued to use the algorithms written in Matlab for easy prototyping and modifications. Python was used as glue and to implement all modules, see \sectionref{sec:sysoverview}.

Using other languages or platforms, such as Julia, C, C++, or Python with NumPy or SciPy could give performance improvements, but it's not in the scope of this thesis.  It's valuable to continue with a platform familiar to Comordo as they are in the startup phase with a focus on prototyping and performance enhancements can come later.
