\section{Development methodology}

\textit{The software development side of the thesis}

The software will be developed using agile inspired methods. Iterative development will be used to produce a simple prototype and then iteratively improve and add more features. The early priority is to produce a working chain from reading data to storing recommendations in the database.

Small incremental goals will be used, an example goal could be to complete a reader plugin for a specific dataset.  Automatic tests and unit tests shall be used but not in the test driven development way, the requirement for the tests being made before the functionality is relaxed and not required.


\subsection{Programming languages}

The existing algorithms exists in a prototype form in Matlab. The thesis will continue to use the algorithms written in Matlab for easy prototyping and modifications. Python will be used as glue and be used to implement all modules, see \sectionref{sec:sysoverview}.

Using other languages or platforms, such as Julia, C, C++, or Python with NumPy or SciPy could give performance improvements, but it's not in the scope of this thesis.  It's valuable to continue with a platform familiar to Comordo as they are in the startup phase with a focus on prototyping and performance enhancements can come later.
