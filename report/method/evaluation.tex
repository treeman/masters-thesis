\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:method:eval}

The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated using \textit{Precision}, \textit{Recall} and \textit{F-measure} compared to the test set.  
\Warning[TODO]{ Comment on alternative evaluation methods. RMSE, rank, accuracy, ... ? }

Running time of the algorithms during learning and recommendation with predetermined parameters will be compared and evaluated.
\Warning[TODO]{ What alternatives do we have? }
