\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:method:eval}

Recommendation quality was evaluated using \textit{Precision}, \textit{Recall} and \textit{F-measure} with top-10 recommendations. Focus was on \textit{F-measure} as a combined measure of \textit{Precision} and \textit{Recall}.

The following steps describes the steps taken to produce evaluations given the training, validation and test sets $A_{train}$, $A_{val}$ and $A_{test}$:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Produce recommendation predictions $p_{u, i}$ from $A_{train}$ with the chosen algorithm.
    \item Transform $p_{u, i}$ to a set of binary recommendations $r_{u, i}$ using the top-10 most predicted items for each user, by the process described in \chapterref{cha:theory}.
    \item Evaluate \textit{F-measure}, as described in \sectionref{sec:background:theory:eval}, with $e_{u, i}$ representing $A_{val}$ or $A_{test}$, depending on which set to evaluate against.
\end{enumerate}

If not explicitly noted, the evaluation set was the test set.
