\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:method:eval}

Recommendation quality was evaluated using \textit{Precision}, \textit{Recall} and \textit{F-measure}. First recommendations were produced using the training set $A_{train}$ and then evaluated against the test set $A_{test}$ w.r.t. the evaluation metrics. It is also possible to evaluate against the valudation set $A_{val}$ instead of against the test set. Whenever that was done it will be explicitly noted.
