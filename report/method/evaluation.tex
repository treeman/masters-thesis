\Warning[TODO]{ Rewrite this section }

The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated using \textit{Precision}, \textit{Recall} and \textit{F-measure} compared to the test set.

Running time of the algorithms during learning and recommendation with predetermined parameters will be compared and evaluated.
