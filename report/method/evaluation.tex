\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:method:eval}

Recommendation quality is evaluated using \textit{Precision}, \textit{Recall} and \textit{F-measure} with top-10 recommendations, as described in \sectionref{sec:background:theory:eval}. Focus is on \textit{F-measure} as a combined measure of \textit{Precision} and \textit{Recall}.

The following steps describes the steps taken to produce evaluations given the training, validation and test sets $A_{train}$, $A_{val}$ and $A_{test}$:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Produce recommendation predictions matrix $P$ from $A_{train}$ with the chosen algorithm.
    \item Transform $P$ to the recommendation matrix $R$ using the top-10 most predicted items for each user.
    \item Evaluate \textit{F-measure} with $e_{u, i}$ representing $A_{val}$ or $A_{test}$, depending on which set to evaluate against.
\end{enumerate}

The validation set $A_{val}$ is used to evaluate the choice of $k$ as the rank-$k$ SVD approximation in \textit{katz-eig}. All other evaluations are done against the test set $A_{test}$.
